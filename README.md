Test for Ruby On Rails

## How do I get set up? ##

This application is powered by [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org).

### System dependencies ###

System running the app must have:

- Ruby 3.1.2
- Rails 7.0.4.3
- PostgreSQL >= 12

### App code and dependencies ###

To get app code and its required libraries:

- clone `git@github.com:Manuel-IA/prueba-tecnica-ror.git` repository
- `cd` into the new directory then `bundle install` to install app dependencies from rubygems

### Database configuration ###

The app relies on a database to store and retrieve its data:

- set credentials for databases in `config/database.yml`
- run `bin/rails db:setup`
